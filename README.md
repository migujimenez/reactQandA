# reactQandA

This is a project built following the book ASP.NET Core 5 and React by Carl Rippon.

I'm happy because it was easy to follow, you can see the results working and also because I had to modify some code to make it work. 

The frontend is a SPA in React.
The Backend is .NET Core with Dapper and SQL Server. 
Authentication with Auth0. 
Unit testing with XUnit and Jest. 
Integration testing with Cypress. 
Deployed in Azure Resource Group.
CI/CD with Azure DevOps.
